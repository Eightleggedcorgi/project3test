# Disaster Catalogue Backend

## Description
Ever wanted to catalogue the natural disasters nearest and dearest to your heart, so you can really get a feel for the trend of annihilation the world inexorably marches towards? Me too! Here at [REDACTED] inc. we thought it would be just a lovely thing to be able to check up on the weather and see the worst it can do to us, so we made it happen.

## Brief Example

## User Stories
* As a user, I should be able to make permanent additions, edits, and deletions to the catalogue by way of mongodb
* As a user, the bloody thing should run with no hitches once I do "node server.js"
* As a user, I don't really care about how hideous the backend is as long as it lets the routes and models work correctly and interact with each other

## Technologies Used
* Cors
* Dotenv
* Express
* Mongoose
* Nodemon
* Mostly Express

## Installation Instructions
Fork or at least clone down the git repo, use your terminal to cd into the backend and frontend folders, doing an "npm i" inside of both

Then lastly you'll want to recreate a .env file in the backend folder

The port can be any unused port really, and you can use any mongo key you like.

## Contribution Guidelines
Honestly anything. This unholy monstrosity is held together with popsicle sticks and elmer's glue. Fork and fiddle with it as you please and we'll probably take whatever you do.
