# Disaster Catalogue Frontend

## Description
We know you've always wanted a beautiful site where you can easily check up on the weather and also log all the horrible ways it tries to destroy everything we love. Now, that site is finally here!

## Brief Example
![alt text](Project3screen.PNG)

## User Stories
* As a user, I should be able to easily navigate the site to anywhere I want to be, and preferably also backtrack without mashing the back button every time
* As a user, the bloody thing should run with no hitches once I inut "npm run dev"
* As a user, the styling should be appealing enough to draw me in and keep me there, or at least be nice enough to not make my eyes instantaneously bleed
* As a user, I expect the website to be user-friendly, hopefully more than how good it looks

## Technologies Used
* Vite
* React
* React-Dom
* React-Router-Dom
* Eslint
* Really Mostly React

## Installation Instructions
Fork or at least clone down the git repo, use your terminal to cd into the backend and frontend folders, doing an "npm i" inside of both

Then lastly you'll want to recreate a .env file in the backend folder

The port can be any unused port really, and you can use any mongo key you like if you want any changes you make to stick.

## Contribution Guidelines
Honestly anything. This unholy monstrosity is held together with popsicle sticks and elmer's glue. Fork and fiddle with it as you please and we'll probably take whatever you do.
